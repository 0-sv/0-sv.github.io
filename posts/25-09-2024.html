    work philosophy
  </h1>
  <p>
    I noticed how hedonic adaptation plays a significant role in my life. It feels like my mind gravitates towards the next best thing, whether that would be a new job, house or car.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course I turned to Google for my life philosophy, which lead me to Reddit (since all of my Google searches include a " reddit" suffix).
  </p>
  <p>
    I found some words of insight in the Desiderata:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-indigo-500 italic my-8 p-4 text-gray-600 rounded-r-lg shadow-md">
    <p class="mb-4">Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant, they too have their story.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let not this blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Therefore, be at peace with God, whatever you conceive him to be. And whatever your labours and aspirations in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams; it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.</p>

    I wondered if this could be rewritten for my corporate life. Asking Claude to rewrite it, the result is similarly intriguing:
  </p>

  <blockquote class="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-indigo-500 italic my-8 p-4 text-gray-600 rounded-r-lg shadow-md">
    <p class="mb-4">Approach your work with purpose and diligence, remembering that even in the busiest moments, there is value in thoughtful pause.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Cultivate positive relationships with all colleagues, but not at the expense of your integrity or well-being.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Communicate your ideas with clarity and conviction, yet remain open to the perspectives of others, for every team member has something to contribute.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Steer clear of office politics and negativity, as they drain energy and hinder progress.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Measure your growth against your own potential, not the success of others; there will always be those more or less accomplished than you.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Take pride in your accomplishments and be excited about future projects. Remain passionate about your work, regardless of its scale; it is your unique contribution to the world.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Be prudent in your professional decisions, for the business world can be unpredictable. Yet, do not let caution overshadow the abundance of opportunity and innovation around you.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Stay true to your values and authentic self. Don't pretend to be someone you're not, and don't become jaded about your profession; even in challenging times, there is purpose in what you do.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Embrace the wisdom that comes with experience, adapting gracefully to new technologies and methodologies.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Build resilience to weather professional setbacks, but don't dwell on potential failures. Many workplace anxieties stem from overwork and isolation.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Practice self-care and maintain a healthy work-life balance. You are more than your job title; you have inherent worth beyond your professional achievements.</p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">Therefore, find peace in your career path, whatever it may be. Amidst the deadlines, meetings, and daily grind, maintain your inner calm. Despite its challenges and disappointments, your work contributes to a greater whole. Stay positive. Strive to find fulfillment in your professional journey.</p>

    Perpetual dissatisfaction is a double-edged sword. While it can drive innovation, personal growth, and the pursuit of excellence, it also risks robbing us of contentment and appreciation for our present circumstances. The key lies in striking a balance: nurturing ambition while cultivating gratitude, striving for improvement while acknowledging progress, and setting high standards while accepting imperfection. True fulfillment often comes not from achieving an elusive state of perfection, but from finding joy in the journey of continuous growth and appreciating the milestones along the way. (also Claude)
